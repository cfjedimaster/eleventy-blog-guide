## A Complete Guide to Building a Blog with Eleventy

Welcome to my guide to building a blog with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). The guide itself may be found here:

https://cfjedimaster.github.io/eleventy-blog-guide/guide

I'm calling this a "complete" guide as it walks you through all the steps to build a blog, but obviously it doesn't cover every possible feature. I'm absolutely open to PRs and issues, but please keep the intent in mind - helping someone who has just learned Eleventy how to create a working blog. 

### Updates

**August 8, 2022**: Typo fix. Thank you to David M for the find.
